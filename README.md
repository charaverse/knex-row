knex-row is a lightweight row interface for Knex.js. It provides a more
type-safe interface on top of Knex.js connection and query objects.

> Please note that while knex-row can be used with any databases supported by
> Knex.js, knex-row is currently only tested against MySQL. Some functions such
> as `insert` might behave differently with other databases.
